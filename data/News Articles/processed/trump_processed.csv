Corrupt judges, or judges so blinded by their hatred of me and my political ideology to ‚ÄúMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,‚Äù are making a mockery of the United States Judicial System, and the World is watching in disgust. Deranged Jack Smith, the evil and sinister prosecutor appointed by Crooked Joe Biden to ‚Äútake me down,‚Äù was found to be illegally appointed by a CORRUPT DOJ and FBI, and all of his many charges against me were dropped or dismissed. His illegal raid of my home, Mar-a-Lago, will go down as one of the ‚Äúdirtiest tricks‚Äù ever perpetrated by one candidate, a dumb as a rock, Sleepy Joe Biden, on another.

The accountant testified, with total corroboration, that the records were perfect & totally above board. A legal expense was called, on the books, a legal expense. There was nothing else it could have been called. This was the so-called falsifying of records. I was hiding nothing, everything was out in the open for all to see. Every legal scholar of note said there IS NO CASE AGAINST ME. The judge should be disbarred! This is why people, and companies, are FLEEING New York - A corrupt court system. In another crooked New York case, another corrupt Judge (overturned 5 times on my case alone, & the most overturned judge in New York!) valued Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida, at $18,000,000, when it is worth 50 to 100 times that amount‚Ä¶.And then we have, also in New York, the woman I never met (celebrity photo lines from 30 years ago don‚Äôt count!), who was awarded almost $100,000,000.
