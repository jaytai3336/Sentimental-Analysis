1/3/2025 13:25,"Biden gave Liz Cheney a Medal yesterday, even though she has proven to be totally corrupt. She, ?€?Bennie?€? Thompson, and the rest of the Unselect Committee, destroyed and deleted all evidence from their crooked investigation of January 6th. Cheney has the distinction of losing her Congressional seat by the largest margin in History! The people of Wyoming understood how bad for our Country she was, but Biden rewarded her only because she hated ?€?TRUMP.?€? She?€?s a Warmonger of low intelligence. All she wants to do is kill people in ?€?Endless Wars,?€? with no gain other than to defense companies. Liz Cheney, Cryin?€? Adam Kinzinger, Bennie Thompson, and the rest of these dishonest Thugs have gotten away with horrible things under the pretense of January 6th. Nancy Pelosi refused to accept the help which was offered for security. She is responsible, and admitted as much, for all to see, on her daughter?€?s tape. They have destroyed the lives of many people, and are rewarded by getting Biden Fake Medals. This is not America. January 20th cannot come fast enough.
