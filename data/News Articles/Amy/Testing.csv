However, exporters in industries like dairy and furniture have warned that the strong zloty is hurting competitiveness abroad and pushing for lower interest rates. Despite concerns, the central bank remains focused on inflation and wage growth, and policymakers are unlikely to adjust rates for now. The zloty has gained over 5% since November, with recent data showing a decline in exports, which is raising concerns over its impact on the broader economy.",NEU

This marks the fifth month in six that core CPI has advanced by 0.3%, signaling persistent inflation. The overall Consumer Price Index (CPI) is also forecast to rise 0.3%, mainly driven by higher food and energy costs. The Federal Reserve is likely to maintain its cautious stance on interest rate adjustments, with inflation risks skewed to the upside. Seasonal factors, like price hikes at the start of the year, may contribute to the uptick.
